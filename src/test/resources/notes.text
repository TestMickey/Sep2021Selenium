Page Object Model- what do you mean byt POM and what is the properties of it?
-for every page in website/mobile app we create separate page java class. 
-never use assertions in page class
-page actions need to provide the page behaviour

-user encapsulation concept
Tests- can be created in seperate folder for each page class
-user test client according to the language.
-Asssertions should be given here
